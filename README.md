# Statistics_Animation_Plot


**Must install packages from `Required packages.R`**

**Must run `saveGIF_simple.R` to generated plot**



IDEAS FOR ANIMATING BASIC STATISTICS:

1. Show how the mean and median pull away from the mode when a distribution becomes skewed (positively and negatively)

2. **(COMPLETED)** Show how the variance and SD change when the spread of scores in a distribution changes.

3. Show how a Z-score is affected by (a) X – M (positive and negative and magnitude), and (b) SD (more or less).

4. Show how the p-value for a Z-score changes with (a) X – M, and (b) SD (Sigma_x).

5. Show how the Z for a sample mean is affected by (a) X – mu, and (b) Sigma_x.

6. Show how the p-value for a sample mean changes with (a) X – mu, and (b) Sigma_x.

7. Show how changes in X-mu and sigma_x and N influence the location of a sample mean Z relative to the critical value of Z (i.e. 1.96 or 2.58). i.e. Can we flash lights when Zm exceeds 1.96 in absolute value (i.e. when Ho should be rejected)?

8. Show how Single Sample t is affected by X-M, SDx, and n. i.e. Can we flash lights when t exceeds the critical value (reject Ho)?

9. Show how Independent Samples t is affected by M-M, SD_pooled, and n. Can we flash lights when t exceeds the critical value?

10. Show how Levene’s Test is affected with SD_1 differs from SD_2.

11. Show how Dependent Samples t is affected by M_D, SD_D, and n.

12. Show how ONEWAY ANOVA is affected by (a) SSB, (b) dfB, (c) SSW, and (d) dfW. 

13. Show how r is affected by the shape of a scatterplot. Show how r is affected by (a) outliers, (b) curvilinearity).
